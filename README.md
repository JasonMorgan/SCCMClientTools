SCCMClientTools
===============

A repository for functions relating to actions by the SCCM Client

This repository will store the Module file for the SCCM client tools.  
The goal is to support PowerShell V2 as much as possible.  That being
said V3 will be used if we can get a significant improvement.  At 
this point it is still a work in progress the module file is pretty
sparse and we haven't built a manifest.
